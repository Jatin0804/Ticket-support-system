# Ticket-support-system
Develop a Ticket Support System where users can log in, submit tickets, and track their status. Admins should be able to log in, view, manage, and resolve tickets. This project will work on React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, as well as the ability to develop a full-stack application.
